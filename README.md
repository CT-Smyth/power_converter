VDM power_converter

A control system for controlling cheap power supply bricks (sold commonly as LED drivers, power supplies, etc) to make them suitable for battery charging or other low resistance variable loads. 

The circuit monitors current output from the power supply with a hall effect sensor, and adjusts a digipot which is wired to replace the trimmer pot normally used to adjust output voltage.
